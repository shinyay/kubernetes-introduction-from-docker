# Chapter 1: Creating Docker Containers

In this chapter, weâ€™ll dive into the basics of Docker, the foundation of modern containerized applications. You'll learn how to create, manage, and run Docker containers, which are essential building blocks for Kubernetes.

---

## Chapter Objectives

- Understand the core concepts of Docker and containers
- Learn how to write a `Dockerfile` to containerize an application
- Build and run Docker containers locally
- Manage Docker images and containers effectively

## 1-1. What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that simplifies the process of building, running, and managing containers. Containers package applications and their dependencies into a single unit that can run reliably across different computing environments.

### Key Features:
- Lightweight and fast
- Portable and consistent across environments
- Secure by isolating applications

## 1-2. Writing Your First Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` is a script of instructions that tells Docker how to build an image. Here's a simple example:

```dockerfile
# Use a lightweight base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

## 1-3. Building and Running Docker Containers

### Steps:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-app .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
   ```

3. Stop and remove the container:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   docker stop <container-id>
   docker rm <container-id>
   ```

## 1-4. Managing Docker Images and Containers

### Docker Commands:

- List images:
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```
- Remove an image:
  ```bash
  docker rmi <image-id>
  ```
- List running containers:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
- List all containers:
  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```
