# Chapter 3: Overview of Kubernetes

In this chapter, weâ€™ll introduce Kubernetes, the powerful container orchestration platform. Youâ€™ll gain an understanding of its key concepts, components, and how it helps manage containerized applications at scale.

## 3-1. What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, it is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

### Key Features:
- **Container Orchestration:** Manages containerized applications across multiple hosts.
- **Self-Healing:** Automatically restarts failed containers or reschedules them on healthy nodes.
- **Scalability:** Dynamically scales applications up or down based on demand.
- **Declarative Configuration:** Uses YAML manifests to define the desired state of applications and infrastructure.

## 3-2. Kubernetes Core Concepts

At the heart of Kubernetes are several key abstractions:

- **Pod:** The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing one or more containers that share the same network and storage.
- **Node:** A worker machine (physical or virtual) where Pods run.
- **Namespace:** A way to divide cluster resources into logical groups.
- **Service:** Exposes a Pod or set of Pods to the network, providing stable access even as Pods are replaced.
- **Deployment:** Manages the desired state of your application, ensuring the right number of Pods are running.

**Illustration:**

## 3-3. Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes has a modular architecture consisting of:

### Control Plane:
- **API Server:** The interface for interacting with Kubernetes (via `kubectl`, APIs, or other tools).
- **Scheduler:** Assigns Pods to Nodes based on resource availability and constraints.
- **Controller Manager:** Ensures the cluster's actual state matches its desired state.
- **etcd:** A distributed key-value store that serves as Kubernetes' source of truth.

### Worker Nodes:
- **Kubelet:** Ensures containers are running as specified in the Pod definitions.
- **Kube-proxy:** Manages networking rules for inter-Pod communication.
- **Container Runtime:** Runs containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O, Docker).

## 3-4. Benefits of Kubernetes

Kubernetes provides several advantages:

1. **Portability:** Run applications consistently across different environments (local, cloud, hybrid).
2. **Efficiency:** Optimize resource usage through intelligent scheduling and scaling.
3. **Resilience:** Built-in self-healing and fault tolerance features.
4. **Extensibility:** Add custom resources and controllers to extend Kubernetes' capabilities.
5. **Ecosystem:** Vast ecosystem of tools and integrations (e.g., Helm, Prometheus, Istio).

**Illustration:**
