# Chapter 7: Creating Secure Stateless Applications

In this chapter, we'll focus on building stateless applications in Kubernetes with a strong emphasis on security. Stateless applications are easier to scale and manage, and securing them ensures a robust and reliable deployment. While we'll focus on stateless applications here, the security principles we cover will also apply to stateful applications that you might work with in the future.

## Chapter Objectives

- Understand the characteristics of stateless applications
- Learn how to create secure stateless applications in Kubernetes
- Explore best practices for securing Pods and containers
- Use Kubernetes features like Secrets and NetworkPolicies for security

## 7-1. What Are Stateless Applications?

Stateless applications do not maintain any persistent state between requests. Examples include:
- Web servers (e.g., NGINX, Apache)
- API gateways
- Frontend applications

### Advantages:
- Easy to scale horizontally
- Resilient to failures (state is stored elsewhere, like databases)

**Illustration:**

## 7-2. Deploying a Stateless Application

### Example Deployment Manifest:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: stateless-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: stateless-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: stateless-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: stateless-app
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Apply and expose the application:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl expose deployment stateless-app --type=ClusterIP --port=80
```

Verify:
```bash
kubectl get services
kubectl get pods
```

## 7-3. Securing Stateless Applications

### Security Best Practices:
1. **Run as Non-Root:**
   Add a security context:
   ```yaml
   securityContext:
     runAsNonRoot: true
     runAsUser: 1000
   ```

2. **Use Secrets for Sensitive Data:**
   Example Secret:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: app-secret
   type: Opaque
   data:
     API_KEY: bXktc2VjcmV0LWFwaS1rZXk=
   ```
   Mount the Secret as an environment variable:
   ```yaml
   env:
   - name: API_KEY
     valueFrom:
       secretKeyRef:
         name: app-secret
         key: API_KEY
   ```

3. **Restrict Network Access:**
   Use NetworkPolicies:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: allow-only-frontend
   spec:
     podSelector:
       matchLabels:
         app: stateless-app
     ingress:
     - from:
       - podSelector:
           matchLabels:
             role: frontend
   ```

4. **Regularly Scan Images:**
   Use tools like Trivy or Clair to scan container images for vulnerabilities.

**Illustration:**

## 7-4. Testing Security Configurations

### Validate NetworkPolicies:
1. Create a test Pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl run test-pod --image=busybox --restart=Never -- /bin/sh
   ```
2. Attempt to access the stateless app:
   ```bash
   wget <stateless-app-service-ip>:80
   ```

Expected Behavior:
- Access will be blocked if NetworkPolicies are configured correctly.

**Illustration:**
