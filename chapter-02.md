# Chapter 2: Creating a Kubernetes Cluster

In this chapter, weâ€™ll set up your first Kubernetes cluster, the foundation for managing containerized applications at scale. Whether youâ€™re using local tools or a cloud provider, youâ€™ll learn the steps to create and access a cluster.

---

## Chapter Objectives

- Understand what a Kubernetes cluster is and its components
- Set up a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube
- Explore alternatives for cloud-based Kubernetes clusters
- Practice accessing and interacting with the cluster using `kubectl`

## 2-1. What is a Kubernetes Cluster?

A Kubernetes cluster consists of:
- **Control Plane**: Manages the clusterâ€™s state and makes scheduling decisions.
- **Nodes**: Machines (virtual or physical) that run the containerized applications.

**Illustration:**

## 2-2. Setting Up a Local Cluster with Minikube

Minikube lets you run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine.

### Steps:
1. Install Minikube:
   ```bash
   curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
   sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
   ```

2. Start Minikube:
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```

3. Verify the cluster is running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

**Illustration:**

## 2-3. Exploring Cloud-Based Kubernetes Clusters

Cloud providers offer managed Kubernetes services:
- **Amazon EKS**
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**

These services handle the control plane for you.

## 2-4. Accessing the Cluster with `kubectl`

`kubectl` is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes.

### Common Commands:
- List all nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
- View cluster information:
  ```bash
  kubectl cluster-info
  ```
- Deploy an application:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=nginx
  ```

**Illustration:**
Captain Kube typing `kubectl` commands to deploy an application and view its status.

## Chapter Summary & Key Takeaways

- A Kubernetes cluster consists of the control plane and nodes.
- Minikube is a great tool for setting up a local cluster.
- Cloud providers offer managed Kubernetes clusters with less operational overhead.
- `kubectl` is the primary tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
