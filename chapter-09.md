# Chapter 9: Understanding the Kubernetes Architecture

In this chapter, weâ€™ll take a closer look at the Kubernetes architecture. Youâ€™ll learn how its components work together to orchestrate containers, manage resources, and maintain the desired state of your applications.

## Chapter Objectives

- Understand the core components of the Kubernetes control plane
- Learn about the worker nodes and their responsibilities
- Explore how Kubernetes maintains the desired state of the cluster
- Gain insight into the flow of requests and resource management

## 9-1. Core Components of the Kubernetes Control Plane

The control plane manages the cluster and ensures the desired state is maintained.

### Components:
1. **API Server:** The interface for interacting with Kubernetes (via `kubectl` or APIs).
2. **etcd:** A key-value store that serves as Kubernetesâ€™ source of truth.
3. **Scheduler:** Assigns Pods to Nodes based on resource availability and constraints.
4. **Controller Manager:** Ensures resources match their desired state (e.g., maintaining the correct number of Pods in a Deployment).

**Illustration:**

## 9-2. Worker Nodes and Their Responsibilities

Worker nodes run the actual workloads (containers).

### Key Components:
1. **Kubelet:** Ensures containers are running as specified in the Pod definition.
2. **Kube-proxy:** Manages networking rules for inter-Pod communication and external access.
3. **Container Runtime:** Runs and manages containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O, Docker).

**Illustration:**

## 9-3. Flow of Requests in Kubernetes

When you deploy an application, Kubernetes processes the request as follows:
1. The `kubectl apply` command sends a request to the **API Server**.
2. The **API Server** writes the desired state to **etcd**.
3. The **Scheduler** assigns the Pod to a Node.
4. The **Kubelet** on the Node pulls the container image and runs the Pod.
5. The **Controller Manager** ensures the desired number of Pods are running.

## 9-4. Maintaining the Desired State

Kubernetes uses a reconciliation loop to maintain the desired state defined in manifests.

### Example:
If a Pod crashes or a node fails, Kubernetes:
1. Detects the failure via the **Controller Manager**.
2. Schedules a new Pod on a healthy Node using the **Scheduler**.
3. Updates the cluster state in **etcd**.

**Illustration:**

## Chapter Summary & Key Takeaways

- The control plane manages the cluster and ensures the desired state is maintained.
- Worker nodes run containers and handle networking.
- Requests flow through the API Server, etcd, Scheduler, and Kubelet.
- Kubernetes automatically reconciles the actual state with the desired state.
