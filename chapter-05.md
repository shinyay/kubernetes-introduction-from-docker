# Chapter 5: Troubleshooting Guide and Using `kubectl` Commands

Troubleshooting is an essential skill for working with Kubernetes. In this chapter, we'll focus on using `kubectl`, the Kubernetes command-line tool, to inspect, debug, and fix issues in your cluster. You'll learn how to identify common problems and resolve them effectively.

---

## Chapter Objectives

- Understand the role of `kubectl` in troubleshooting
- Learn commands to inspect the state of Kubernetes resources
- Use logs and events to identify issues
- Debug common problems with Pods, Deployments, and Services
- Practice effective troubleshooting strategies

## 5-1. The Role of `kubectl` in Troubleshooting

`kubectl` is the primary tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to:
- Inspect the state of resources (Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.)
- View logs and events to understand issues
- Debug misconfigurations and errors
- Apply or modify configurations

Mastering `kubectl` commands is key to effective troubleshooting.

## 5-2. Inspecting Resource States

### Common Commands:
1. List all resources in a namespace:
   ```bash
   kubectl get all -n <namespace>
   ```

2. View detailed information about a specific resource:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe <resource-type> <resource-name>
   ```

3. Check the status of Pods:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

4. Watch resources over time:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -w
   ```

**Illustration:**

## 5-3. Using Logs to Identify Issues

Logs are a vital source of information when troubleshooting.

### View Logs for a Pod:
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

### Follow Logs in Real-Time:
```bash
kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
```

### For Multi-Container Pods:
Specify the container name:
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>
```

## 5-4. Debugging Pods with `kubectl exec`

Sometimes, you need to interact directly with a container to debug issues.

### Execute a Shell Inside a Container:
```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh
```

### Run a One-Time Command:
```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- ls /app
```

**Illustration:**

## 5-5. Understanding Events in Kubernetes

Events provide insights into whatâ€™s happening in the cluster.

### View Events in a Namespace:
```bash
kubectl get events -n <namespace>
```

### Describe a Resource to See Related Events:
```bash
kubectl describe <resource-type> <resource-name>
```

**Illustration:**

## 5-6. Debugging Common Issues

### Pod Stuck in Pending State
- **Problem:** No available nodes meet the Podâ€™s requirements.
- **Solution:**
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```

### CrashLoopBackOff
- **Problem:** The container keeps crashing.
- **Solution:**
  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  ```

### Service Not Accessible
- **Problem:** The Service isnâ€™t routing traffic correctly.
- **Solution:**
  ```bash
  kubectl describe service <service-name>
  kubectl get endpoints <service-name>
  ```

## 5-7. Effective Troubleshooting Strategies

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow Down:**
   - Use `kubectl get` to check the overall state.
   - Drill down with `kubectl describe` and `kubectl logs`.

2. **Check Resource Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that related resources (e.g., Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps) are configured correctly.

3. **Use Namespaces:**
   - Always check the namespace of the resources youâ€™re inspecting.

4. **Leverage Documentation:**
   - Use the Kubernetes documentation and community forums for guidance.
